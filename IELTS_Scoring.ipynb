You will make evaluation based on the topic and student's response.\\nYou should grade the essay general score and in 4 metrics in IELTS Writing, which are Task Response, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. \\nThe overall must be the mean value of 4 metric scores and can be a float value between 0 and 9 (round to .5), but each metric score should be an integer between 0 and 9.\\nRecall the IELTS Writing band score criteria.\\nHere are the criteria for each metric at each band score:\\n\\n**Task Response:**\\nBand 8:\\nThe prompt is appropriately and sufficiently addressed.\\nA clear and well-developed position is presented in response to the question.\\nIdeas are relevant, well extended and supported.\\nThere may be occasional omissions or lapses in content.\\n\\nBand 7:\\nThe main parts of the prompt are appropriately addressed.\\nA clear and developed position is presented.\\nMain ideas are extended and supported but there may be a tendency to over-generalise or there may be a lack of focus and precision in supporting ideas/material.\\n\\nBand 6:\\nThe main parts of the prompt are addressed (though some may be more fully covered than others). An appropriate format is used.\\nA position is presented that is directly relevant to the prompt, although the conclusions drawn may be unclear, unjustified or repetitive.\\nMain ideas are relevant, but some may be insufficiently developed or may lack clarity, while some supporting arguments and evidence may be less relevant or inadequate.\\n\\nBand 5:\\nThe main parts of the prompt are incompletely addressed. The format may be inappropriate in places.\\nThe writer expresses a position, but the development is not always clear.\\nSome main ideas are put forward, but they are limited and are not sufficiently developed and/or there may be irrelevant detail.\\nThere may be some repetition.\\n\\nBand 4:\\nThe prompt is tackled in a minimal way, or the answer is tangential, possibly due to some misunderstanding of the prompt. The format may be inappropriate.\\nA position is discernible, but the reader has to read carefully to find it.\\nMain ideas are difficult to identify and such ideas that are identifiable may lack relevance, clarity and/or support.\\nLarge parts of the response may be repetitive.\\n\\n**Coherence and cohesion**\\nBand 8:\\nThe message can be followed with ease.\\nInformation and ideas are logically sequenced, and cohesion is well managed.\\nOccasional lapses in coherence and cohesion may occur.\\nParagraphing is used sufficiently and appropriately.\\n\\nBand 7:\\nInformation and ideas are logically organised, and there is a clear progression throughout the response. (A few lapses may occur, but these are minor.)\\nA range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use.\\nParagraphing is generally used effectively to support overall coherence, and the sequencing of ideas within a paragraph is generally logical.\\n\\nBand 6:\\nInformation and ideas are generally arranged coherently and there is a clear overall progression.\\nCohesive devices are used to some good effect but cohesion within and/or between sentences may be faulty or mechanical due to misuse, overuse or omission.\\nThe use of reference and substitution may lack flexibility or clarity and result in some repetition or error.\\nParagraphing may not always be logical and/or the central topic may not always be clear.\\n\\nBand 5:\\nOrganisation is evident but is not wholly logical and there may be a lack of overall progression. Nevertheless, there is a sense of underlying coherence to the response.\\nThe relationship of ideas can be followed but the sentences are not fluently linked to each other.\\nThere may be limited/overuse of cohesive devices with some inaccuracy.\\nThe writing may be repetitive due to inadequate and/or inaccurate use of reference and substitution.\\nParagraphing may be inadequate or missing.\\n\\nBand 4:\\nInformation and ideas are evident but not arranged coherently and there is no clear progression within the response.\\nRelationships between ideas can be unclear and/or inadequately marked. There is some use of basic cohesive devices, which may be inaccurate or repetitive.\\nThere is inaccurate use or a lack of substitution or referencing.\\nThere may be no paragraphing and/or no clear main topic within paragraphs.\\n\\n**Lexical resource**\\nBand 8:\\nA wide resource is fluently and flexibly used to convey precise meanings.\\nThere is skilful use of uncommon and/or idiomatic items when appropriate, despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation.\\nOccasional errors in spelling and/or word formation may occur, but have minimal impact on communication.\\n\\nBand 7:\\nInformation and ideas are logically organised, and there is a clear progression throughout the response. (A few lapses may occur, but these are minor.)\\nA range of cohesive devices including reference and substitution is used flexibly but with some inaccuracies or some over/under use.\\nParagraphing is generally used effectively to support overall coherence, and the sequencing of ideas within a paragraph is generally logical.\\n\\nBand 6:\\nThe resource is generally adequate and appropriate for the task.\\nThe meaning is generally clear in spite of a rather restricted range or a lack of precision in word choice.\\nIf the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a wider range of vocabulary used but higher degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.\\nThere are some errors in spelling and/or word formation, but these do not impede communication.\\n\\nBand 5:\\nThe resource is limited but minimally adequate for the task.\\nSimple vocabulary may be used accurately but the range does not permit much variation in expression.\\nThere may be frequent lapses in the appropriacy of word choice and a lack of flexibility is apparent in frequent simplifications and/or repetitions.\\nErrors in spelling and/or word formation may be noticeable and may cause some difficulty for the reader.\\n\\nBand 4:\\nThe resource is limited and inadequate for or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and may be used repetitively.\\nThere may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language and/or language from the input material).\\nInappropriate word choice and/or errors in word formation and/or in spelling may impede meaning\\n\\n**Grammatical range and accuracy**\\nBand 8:\\nA wide range of structures is flexibly and accurately used.\\nThe majority of sentences are error-free, and punctuation is well managed.\\nOccasional, non-systematic errors and inappropriacies occur, but have minimal impact on communication\\n\\nBand 7:\\nA variety of complex structures is used with some flexibility and accuracy.\\nGrammar and punctuation are generally well controlled, and error-free sentences are frequent.\\nA few errors in grammar may persist, but these do not impede communication.\\n\\nBand 6:\\nA mix of simple and complex sentence forms is used but flexibility is limited.\\nExamples of more complex structures are not marked by the same level of accuracy as in simple structures.\\nErrors in grammar and punctuation occur, but rarely impede communication\\n\\nBand 5:\\nThe range of structures is limited and rather repetitive.\\nAlthough complex sentences are attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the greatest accuracy is achieved on simple sentences.\\nGrammatical errors may be frequent and cause some difficulty for the reader.\\nPunctuation may be faulty.\\n\\nBand 4:\\nA very limited range of structures is used.\\nSubordinate clauses are rare and simple sentences predominate.\\nSome structures are produced accurately but grammatical errors are frequent and may impede meaning.\\nPunctuation is often faulty or inadequate.\\nThe formula to calculate the general score is:\\n```\\nGeneral_score = ( ( Task_Response + Coherence_and_Cohesion + Lexical_Resource + Grammatical_Range_and_Accuracy) // 2 ) / 2 \\n```\\n\\nIn each metric, you should give a detailed explanation and point out exactly the student mistakes that led to that score.\\nYour output format should be like this:\\n**General: score**\\nOverall Explanation:\\n`Your detailed explanation`\\n**metric_name : score**\\nExplanation: \\n`Your detailed explanation`\\n\\nFor example:\\n**General: 7**\\nOverall Explanation: Your explanation\\n**Task Response: 6**\\nExplanation: Your explanation\\n**Coherence and Cohesion: 7**\\nExplanation: Your explanation\\n**Lexical Resource: 8**\\nExplanation: Your explanation\\n**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 7**\\nExplanation: Your explanation\\n\\n- The overall score should be the mean value of 4 metric scores, round down to .0 and .5, so make sure your evaluation right.\\n- Provide constructive feedback.\"}]"

The current essay discusses few reasons behind this phenomenon.\\nThere are two main reasons for this phenomenon. As we all know, human nature is full of curiosity. So, everyone who live in a house wants to know about the history of it. However, there are multiple reasons against such otidid. First one is, different problems they are facing always tend them to inquire about the oldness of their place of residence and what are the causes of those issues. Secondly, firmness of building is another strong rational, about which residents are highly concerned. They really want to know the potential of structure and its reliability. People also wonder about has lived in this building before them and what were their experiences related to the place.\\nThere are many methods to discover above mentioned curiosities. Firstly, people can check the history of building in public records. In this way they are able to know who built this building and all other confusions related to the potential soundness of building. Secondly, the most easiest way to inquire is, they can ask neighbors whatever information they want to seek about building.\\nIn conclusion, the primary reason why most people are concerned about background of building they live in is because they are much concerned over the soundness of structure of building and it’s out of natural curiosity. the best way to unearth this information is to ask neighbors or to search public records of the building.\\n    Make sure that you follow the IELTS WRITING task 2 guideline to grade this essay, and do the correct evaluation of general score.\\n    '},\n",

The essay also lacks a clear thesis statement and a logical structure.\\n\\n**Coherence and Cohesion: 5**\\nExplanation: The essay has some coherence, but the writer\\'s ideas are not well-organized, and the transitions between paragraphs are not smooth.

The essay also lacks cohesive devices, such as linking words and phrases, to connect the ideas together.\\n\\n**Lexical Resource: 6**\\nExplanation: The writer uses a limited range of vocabulary, and the language is not sophisticated enough to convey the writer\\'s ideas effectively.

      "There are many methods to discover these curiosities. Firstly, people can check the history of the building in public records. In this way, they are able to know who built the building and all other confusions related to the potential soundness of the building.
