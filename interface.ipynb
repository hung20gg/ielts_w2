      "Explanation: The essay addresses the topic adequately, presenting both sides of the argument and the writer's own opinion. However, the discussion is somewhat superficial, and the writer could benefit from providing more supporting details and examples to strengthen their argument. For instance, the writer mentions that advertisements can be successful in persuading people to buy things, but they do not provide any specific examples or statistics to support this claim. Additionally, the writer's own opinion is not fully developed, and they could benefit from providing more evidence and analysis to support their viewpoint.\n",

      "**Coherence and Cohesion: 7**\n",
      "Explanation: The essay is generally easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer uses transitional phrases to connect ideas, and the linking between paragraphs is mostly smooth. However, there are some instances of repetition, such as the repeated mention of the goal of advertisements to persuade people to buy things.

      "**Lexical Resource: 6**\n",
      "Explanation: The writer uses a moderate range of vocabulary, with some words being repeated throughout the essay. While the language is clear, it is not particularly sophisticated or nuanced. For instance, the writer uses the phrase \"seemingly hypnotize people\" to describe the effect of advertisements, but this phrase is not particularly precise or evocative. The writer could benefit from using more varied and precise vocabulary to describe their ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the writer makes several errors in word choice, such as using the phrase \"after watching a dozen of advertisements\" instead of \"after watching a dozen advertisements\". This error is minor, but it detracts from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the essay.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 6**\n",
      "Explanation: The essay contains several errors in grammar and punctuation, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and incorrect use of commas. For instance, the writer writes \"The goal of advertisements is to get consumers to buy a targeted product, and while this method has been proven considerably successful generally, some people view it as too prevalent to catch the consumers' attention any more.\" This sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by using more varied sentence structures and providing more precise language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writer also uses the phrase \"the repeated sight of the scrumptious food may result in that person feeling hungry and succumbing to the advertisement at last\" which is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased for better clarity.\n",

      "To improve this essay, the writer could benefit from:\n",

      "* Providing more depth and analysis of the topic, including specific examples and statistics to support their claims\n",

      "Advertisement has always been a crucial part of the world of marketing. Throughout the decades, we have seen a significant increase in the amount of advertisements, whether it is on the media like television or widespread through social network platforms. The goal of advertisements is to get consumers to buy a targeted product, and while this method has been proven considerably successful generally, some people view it as too prevalent to catch the consumers' attention any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertisements can act as a strong persuasion device to seemingly hypnotize people into buying goods and services. This is so because of the tactics placed in the messages, such as showing people having a good time together when using a particular product, using bandwagon, showing only the upsides of usage, and applying compare and contrast strategies to show the effects of using the product and make it stand out. Even if people do not know it, these messages are repeated several times and soon it may brainwash people to finally go out and get the product. For instance, if a person is watching television and sees a certain advertisement of a snack many times, the repeated sight of the scrumptious food may result in that person feeling hungry and succumbing to the advertisement at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is another point of view in which the widespread of advertisements makes it a normal thing. After watching a dozen of advertisements, people will see it as a mere everyday routine and cease to pay attention to the message of the advertisement. Some people may even choose to turn off a television channel, for instance, only just to avoid seeing and hearing repetitive advertisements. After a certain frequency, they start to get bored and stop paying attention to ads. Hence, in the end, the main goal of advertisements is not complete since the people whom the messages are sent out to do not receive that message. A real-life example can be seen from advertisements in a particular social media platform, YouTube. In the YouTube marketing mechanism, advertisements are placed before and in between videos, hoping that the viewers would also be forced to watch the advertisements, too. However, this is not usually the case, since many people would just click \"Skip Ad\" and continue on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, advertisements can be successful in persuading people to purchase goods and services, or they can be unsuccessful in many ways. They are very commonly seen nowadays, but not all of them fulfill their purpose. Thus, advertisements must be designed and presented in the correct way to result in the highest effectiveness.\n",
