First of all number of vehicles is incarese day after day which means ever day the world gets more drivers then before. If we admite that alots of people prefer to use public transport we do not have any doubts that many people use the vehicles because of advantage of driving.
The history shows us that the human like to move from place to another for many reasns and the always fell pleased when the rid. This days people have all kind of vehicles bicks, cars, motor...etc because they all have a different advantage.
people needs also can not meet at be found in one pleace for that reason people need to move from a piece to another place to meet thier needs which means the advantage of moving from point to anther point will be exist for ever.
World has bee changed a lot and mamf people have got great jobs with big salaries. The can easly fund thier vehicl and because people get feeling boring if the used to some thing they always perefer to chang thier vehicle from time to time.
Finally I thinK it is very hard to believe that the driverless vehicles with outweigh the disadvantages because people always find drive more and more give thier life meaning and add more advantage to it all kind of vehicles give happeness to a lot of people that they can not think about lossing it
