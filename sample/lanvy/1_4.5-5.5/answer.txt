Nowadays, people think that the modern society has became more selfish and care about themselve more. In my opinion, I think people nowadays are truly became more selfish but this is forces by the modern society so some values should not be returned.
First of all, the modern life has became more busy than before, they will have to take care about themselve, their parents,  their kids if they married and some fees that they have to pay monthly. This leaded to some situations that people have no enough time and money to help other while they cannot even takecare of themselve. Moreover, the new generation has became less outgoing than those old generation because of those smart devices likes phones, computer. This made them feel more confortable when chatting with other online instead of in real life, so they will feel weird when some strenger just talk to them on some topics like weather, news.
In addidion, some people can do everything just for money, for example, 2 elder has fallen, if anyone came for help and they will just said those people made then fall and those people will have to pay for them. With the development of technology, this has been known by everybody that using internet, which made people scared to helping strenger because they cannot make sure those body are really need help or just to scam 

In concluction, people nowadays cannot just simply respect other but also have to make sure that they are a really good person or not. Even more, they do not have that much time to respect and care about everyone they saw.
