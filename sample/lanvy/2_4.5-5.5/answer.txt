Regarding the morden society, greedy and selfish becomes the basis of it. People aruges that we have to create a better environment to live in by bring back the older traditional values, while some hold the opposite opinion. From my perspective, I argree that we should have more traditional activities.

As the consequnece of improved society, one of the pulic concerns must be the individual greed and selfishness. The main reason of it is the overwhelm desire of the benifits from humanlity, people would not be satisfy by their current havings. Greed and selfishness caused the trust issue and conflict among the communities due to people only think about their benefits, worsen can leads to body conflicting. For instance, people used to help each other in the past, but recently, an junior helped an elder, but the elder holds that the junior pushed him and ask for the healing fee.

While the individual greed and selfishness become the community concern, the traditional values such as repsect, sharing, caring for the local residents and pulic are nessessary. These values can be small actions or huge steps, it brings the warmth to the pulic and encourage the individuals become more cooperative. 

In conclusion, it is benificial to have more traditional values returned and contribute to the community for a enhanced living environment instead of keeping the modern values.
